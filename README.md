# pride-frames

_Put a pride flag frame on an image for your profile pictures_

This is a web version of an [Apple Shortcut](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2664/) I made in 2018 that pushed the limits of what you can do with the platform and dynamic image generation using the built-in toolset. The performance of the shortcut got worse overtime and stopped working in 2022.

## special thanks

Thank you [@TheEnbyWitch](https://github.com/TheEnbyWitch) for helping me with my first svelte project.

## limitations

- Safari has a few issues with maximum image widths and can get pretty slow with large amounts of flags added to an image. I've tried to work around this the best I can without strict limitations where possible.
